# NOTICE: this repository is unmaintained and provided for historical purposes only.  
The clevis project now includes TPM 2.0 support, so I would suggest migrating in that direction where possible.  
  
# dracut-tpm
This project provides a *simple* module for dracut to allow reading keys from TPM 1.2 modules to unlock LUKS devices at boot time for openSUSE.

# Requirements
This project uses **ncat** to communicate with the systemd-ask-password socket; this program is available in openSUSE' `ncat` package. 

You'll also need to use a bootloader that supports extending PCRs.  There are some various options for this, including TrustedGrub2, TPM-LUKS, and mjg59's fork of grub.

# NVRAM Access
Additionally, one of the two options for reading from the NVRAM must be chosen:
1. Use **tcsd** and **tpm_nvread** - this requires the `trousers` and `tpm-tools` packages in openSUSE
2. Use the standalone program **nv_readvalue** - this requires building **nv_readvalue** from [this repository](http://github.com/gastamper/tpm-luks)

Why choose one over the other?
**tcsd** and **tpm_nvread** are included in the base repositories for openSUSE, making this path somewhat more straightforward.  As a downside, it is more complicated "under the hood" so for those who prefer simplicity and a slim initramfs, this may not be the ideal options.
**nv_readvalue** however can be built as a standalone program, making this single program the only dependency for the dracut module.

It is ultimately a matter of preference with little practical value.  For most users, option 1 is sufficient.

# Installation
1. Create and store keys in your preferred NVRAM slot (see below)
2. Clone this repository
3. Run install.sh; this performs the following steps:
   1. Ensures that the necessary files, either **tcsd** and **tpm_nvread** or **nv_readvalue** are available on your system.
   2. Ensures that the TPM module is owned, active and enabled.
   3. Update the inst_multiple line in module-setup.sh and remove whichever of nv_readvalue/tcsd & tpm_nvread you **aren't** using.
   4. Creates a directory: /usr/lib/dracut/modules.d/50dracuttpm
   5. Copies the dracut module files to the above directory: *module-setup.sh* and *nv-hook.sh*
4. Reboot system and confirm automatic unlocking works.

# Storing keys in NVRAM
Keys are stored in NVRAM by using the **tpm_nvwrite** command, part of the tpm-tools package.  The steps for performing this process are as follows; note that this assumes that you have already taken ownership (initialized and taken control) of the TPM module using the **tpm_takeownership** command.
```sh
# Create a 1MB RAMFS to hold our data
mkdir -p /mnt/ramfs
mount -t tmpfs -o size=1m tmpfs /mnt/ramfs
chmod 700 /mnt/ramfs
# Generate 256 bytes of random data to serve as our key
# Because password goes through ncat and systemd-ask-password socket it should contain only printable characters
base64 < /dev/random | tr -d "\n" |  head -c 256 > /mnt/ramfs/key
# Define a new NVRAM area at the specified index, of the specified size
# See 'man tpm_nvdefine' for permissions explanation
tpm_nvdefine -i 1 -s 256 -p "OWNERWRITE|READ_STCLEAR" -o <owner_password> [-r <PCR1> -r <PCR2> ... n]
# Write the data to index 1, size 256
tpm_nvwrite -i 1 -s 256 -f /mnt/ramfs/key -z -p
```

# Adding TPM keys to LUKS
The steps below show how to add TPM keys to LUKS without the touching the disk, using a RAMFS.  
```sh
# Create a 1MB RAMFS to hold our data
mkdir -p /mnt/ramfs
mount -t tmpfs -o size=1m tmpfs /mnt/ramfs
chmod 700 /mnt/ramfs
# Store value for existing LUKS key in keyfile
# This is necessary to add new keys to a LUKS device
echo -n "exising_luks_key" > /mnt/ramfs/keyfile
# Read values from the specified NVRAM slot into keyfile
# If using ASCII-only key, can use nv_readvalue:
# nv_readvalue -ix 1 -sz 256 -a | cryptsetup luksAddKey /dev/sda3 - --key-file=/mnt/ramfs/keyfile
# If using random (non-ASCII data), use tpm_nvread to write to an intermediary file
tcsd
tpm_nvread -i 1 -s 256 -f /mnt/ramfs/nvramkey
cryptsetup luksAddKey /dev/sda3 /mnt/ramfs/nvramkey --key-file=/mnt/ramfs/keyfile
# Unmount RAMFS
umount /mnt/ramfs
```

# tpm_nvdefine explained
The **tpm_nvdefine** command is used to not only define the area within the NVRAM in which to store the key, but also to assign a specific set of PCRs (platform configuration registers) to which the area should be bound; in the event that these PCRs change, the NVRAM area will be inaccessible.  This prevents, for example, removing the device from one machine and accessing it from another, or accessing it using a custom kernel or bootloader.

The PCR table is as follows for TPM 1.2:

| PCR Number | Allocation       |
| :---------- | ---------------- |
|0           | BIOS             |
|1         | BIOS configuration |
|2         | Option ROMs |
|3         | Option ROM configuration |
|4         | MBR |
|5         | MBR configuration |
|6         | State transition/wake events |
|7         | Platform manufacturer specification measurement |
|8-15         | Static operating system |
|16         | Debug |
|23         | Application support |

The current status of the PCR is generally visible in */sys/class/tpm/tpm0/pcrs*.

While recommending a specific set of PCRs as 'optimal' is outside of scope for this project, typically PCRs 0 through 5 would provide a reasonable starting point.  It is worth noting that an NVRAM area can be bound to no, one, some, or all PCRs depending on preference, by issuing multiple -r arguments to the **tpm_nvdefine** command.

# The READ_STCLEAR flag
The *READ_STCLEAR* flag may be useful when defining an NVRAM area since it effectively "locks" the NVRAM area from further reading until the next reboot.  This flag may be triggered by issuing a read of size zero to a flagged index, f.e. `tpm_nvread -i 1 -s 0`.

# Using nv_readvalue
If you wish to use nv_readvalue, follow the below instructions:
1. Clone http://github.com/gastamper/tpm-luks
2. Build the TPM-LUKS project:
   1. autreconf -ivf
   2. configure
   3. make
3. Copy nv_readvalue to /usr/bin: `cp swtpm-utils/nv_readvalue /usr/bin`

# Considerations
**tpm_nvdefine** uses GNU _GETPASSWD_ to prompt for passwords if using the --pwdo option (prompt for non-commandline input of owner password), which always attempts to read input from the terminal device rather than stdin.  As a result, input redirection (storing the password in a file in ramfs) is problematic.
